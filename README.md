# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Naomi Berryman**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**CodeMath** is an android app that performs a simple calculation based on user input.  
Users can enter a number, tap a button, and instantly see the result of the math operation displayed on screen.  
This project demonstrates handling input, performing calculations, updating UI elements, and creating an interactive experience.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🧮✨📱**
